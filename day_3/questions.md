## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
Condition statements evaluate to true or false. (==) is seeing if things are equal to each other.
(<) is the less than comparison, seeing if something is less than the other. (>=) is the greater
or equal comparison, seeing if something is greater or equal to each other.

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
This is used to see if a condition meets a certain condition that is decided in the if statement. If these
conditions are not met, then the code moves on to the else portion of the if loop.

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
The syntax for the if statement is:
if condition = something
puts something or does something
else (if the first condition isn't met)
puts something or does something else
end (every loop has to have an end)

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
Besides the 'if' and 'else' conditions, you can use 'elsif' to add multiple conditions.

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement?
if number == 4
  puts "Four!"
elsif number < 4
  puts "Too low!"
elsif number > 4
  puts "Too high!
else
  puts "What did you pick?!"
end

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
You could also use a while loop.
