# Exercise 1 Study Drill Questions
# 1) The 'if' starts an if loop. It runs the code through the parameters that is has laid out
#   below, before the 'end' statement.

# 2) The code under the 'if' does not need to be indented in order for the code to actually run.
#   However, the indentation is used mostly for readability, making sure you code can be easily
#   read and understood by anyone reading it.

# 3) If the 'if' statement is not indentend, the code will still run. However, this is bad form.

# 4) You could use the != (does not equal) expression.
#   Ex. people != cats (This would return true, as the value of people and cats is not the same.)

# 5) If you change the initial values for 'people', 'cats', and 'dogs', then the code will still run,
#   you will just recieve differnt output, due to the comparrisons and math.
