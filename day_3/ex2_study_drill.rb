# Exercise 2 Study Drill Questions

# 1) 'else' is preforming an action if the 'if' condition is not met. 'elsif' allows the code to take a
#   different action if the 'else' and 'if' conditions are both not met.

# 2) Changing the values assigned to the variables (cars, people, trucks) changes the output of the code.
#   This is because the boolean comparisons are no longer the same. Since our code accounts for all
#   different ouctomes, the code still works, it just will return differnet strings.

# 3) cars > people || trucks < cars will return true. This is asking is if the answer 'true'
#   matches the answer of 'cars > people' (which is true) or 'trucks < people' (which is also true.)
